# Face Recognition with Kernel SVM

### In this project, Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis were applied for dimensionality reduction. Polynomial kernel with degree 2 was chosen as the kernel. Linear SVM and K-NN algorithm were also implemented for performance comparisons.

* Language: MATLAB
